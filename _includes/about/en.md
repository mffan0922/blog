**Hi, my friend, welcome visiting my blog site.**

## About ME

This blogger is from Shandong, and currently working in Fujian, who loves poring over many computer things while he himself is not so professional. Privately I think that life lies in finding something to do, because life is so boring if you just do one thing all the time. With regards to my non-professionality, sometimes I have to go with trial and error.

## About FUTURE

Hoping living together with my family as soon as possible, hoping getting married with Miss Liu as fast as I can, hoping covid-19 vanishing like it has never appeared, and hoping everything goes well and the future would be promising!
